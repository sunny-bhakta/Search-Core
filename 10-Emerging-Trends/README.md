# Emerging Trends

Signals and experiments shaping the next generation of search systems.

## 1. Generative AI in Search
- Blend retrieval with LLM summarization or answer synthesis.
- Track hallucination rates, latency impact, and prompt security.
- Version prompts and grounding strategies as first-class artifacts.

## 2. Multimodal Retrieval
- Index and search across text, image, audio, and structured signals together.
- Train or fine-tune models that embed multiple modalities into a shared space.
- Design UX for presenting heterogeneous results coherently.

## 3. Personalization & Contextual Search
- Incorporate user behavior, intent, and real-time context into ranking.
- Respect privacy/consent constraints and provide opt-outs.
- Evaluate personalization gains vs. cold-start impact.

## 4. Federated & On-Device Search
- Split computation between edge devices and centralized clusters.
- Sync partial indexes securely and handle offline scenarios.
- Optimize for battery, bandwidth, and privacy constraints.

## 5. Adaptive Relevancy Models
- Use continuous learning loops (implicit feedback, reinforcement learning).
- Detect model drift and auto-retrain with guardrails.
- Pair interpretable signals with black-box models for auditability.

## 6. Semantic Caching & Memoization
- Cache intermediate query embeddings or vector search results.
- Detect near-duplicate queries via semantic similarity.
- Measure cache benefits vs. staleness risk.

## 7. Conversational & Agentic Interfaces
- Support multi-turn clarification, follow-up filters, and exploration paths.
- Persist conversation state securely and contextually rerank results.
- Instrument satisfaction metrics for dialog-driven flows.

## 8. Privacy-Preserving Search
- Explore differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure enclaves.
- Provide transparency reports and user-controlled retention policies.
- Ensure regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA) for new data uses.

## 9. Sustainability & GreenOps
- Measure carbon intensity per query/cluster region.
- Optimize workloads for renewable-friendly time windows or locations.
- Report sustainability metrics alongside cost/perf dashboards.

## 10. Human-in-the-Loop Relevancy Ops
- Build tooling for editorial boosts, curation, and safe overrides.
- Capture annotator feedback loops and reconcile with algorithmic ranking.
- Track governance of manual interventions to avoid regressions.

### Suggested Next Steps
- Pick one trend aligned with your roadmap and outline a proof-of-concept plan.
- Establish success metrics early (quality, cost, risk) before experimentation.
- Share findings in the repo to keep the learning loop open.
