# Search Learning Path

This repo is organized for hands-on learning of search techniques in Node.js.

## Structure

- `01-tfidf/` — Classic TF-IDF search
- `02-fuse/` — Fuzzy search with Fuse.js
- `03-embeddings/` — Semantic search with embeddings
- `04-hybrid-search/` — Hybrid approaches
- `boosters-ranking/` — Boosters and ranking in search
- `faceting/` — Faceted search and filtering
- `synonyms-expansions/` — Synonyms and query expansion
- `indexing/` — Indexing strategies and concepts
- `vector-search/` — Vector-based (semantic) search
- `elasticsearch-basics/` — Elasticsearch fundamentals
- `postgresql-basics/` — PostgreSQL search basics
- `shared/` — Utilities (document loader, cosine similarity, etc.)

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **TF-IDF**: Learn about term frequency, inverse document frequency, and cosine similarity.
2. **Fuse.js**: Explore fuzzy search and user experience improvements.
3. **Embeddings**: Try semantic search using vector representations.
4. **Hybrid**: Combine lexical and semantic methods for better results.
5. **Boosters & Ranking**: Influence result order for relevance.
6. **Faceting**: Filter and refine results by attributes.
7. **Synonyms & Expansions**: Expand queries for better recall.
8. **Indexing**: Organize data for fast retrieval.
9. **Vector Search**: Use embeddings for semantic similarity.
10. **Elasticsearch**: Learn search engine fundamentals.
11. **PostgreSQL**: Explore search in relational databases.

Each folder has its own README and starter code. Tackle them in order, experiment, and compare results.

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js (if not already installed)
2. Open a terminal in this folder
3. Run code in each topic folder as you progress

Happy learning!
