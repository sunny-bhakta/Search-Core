# Query Expansion

## Use Case
- Improve recall by including synonyms, related terms, or spelling variants in search
- Handle user queries with ambiguous or incomplete terms
- Support multilingual or cross-lingual search
- Enhance search in e-commerce, legal, and academic domains

## History
- Early query expansion used manually curated thesauri (1960s-80s)
- Automated query expansion with statistical and linguistic methods emerged in the 1990s
- Modern systems use embeddings, knowledge graphs, and large language models for expansion

## Production Applications
- Google, Bing, and other search engines (synonym and related term expansion)
- E-commerce (expanding product queries to include variants and synonyms)
- PubMed, legal search, and academic databases
- Voice assistants (handling natural language variations)

## Pros
- Increases recall and finds more relevant results
- Helps users with vague, short, or misspelled queries
- Adapts to language evolution and user intent

## Cons
- May introduce irrelevant results (lower precision)
- Requires good synonym/expansion data or models
- Can increase query processing time
- Hard to tune for highly specific or technical domains
